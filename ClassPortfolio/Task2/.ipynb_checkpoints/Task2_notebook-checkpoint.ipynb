The data provided include air and water temperature measured in degrees celcius; wind direction (in degrees True), speed and gusts measured in metres per second; barometric pressure measured in hectopascals; sea level as measured above \"Tide Guage Zero\" in metres; residual sea levels in metres (e.g. -0.014m indicates that the observed sea level is 0.014m below predicted sea level); and adjusted residuals in metres (e.g. -0.077m indicates that the observed sea level is 0.077m below predicted sea level, adjusted for \"the static barometric pressure effect\"). \n",
